besides using backspace to delete char or words in insert mode, you can use also
control-h, delete previous char
control-w, delete previous word
control-u, delete from cursor until start of line

to move to the next word in insert mode
alt-w move to the next word beginning
alt-e move to the next word ending
alt-b move to the previous word beginning

getting out from inser mode to normal mode, press esc.
say you want to execute normal mode command, but you don't want to comeout from insert mode.
press control-o, it will switch the mode to normal and then press you action, once done it will automatically back to insert mode.
this is very good if you want just need to execute 1 normal mode command while in insert mode.

for example zz, is arranging my cursor to be in the middle of the screen, it will re display the layout.
i am in the middle of editing. i can press esc, and then zz and the got the cursor i want and 
then press i to enter insert mode.
the simple way is, in insert mode, i press control-o and then zz, and then i can continue editing form where i left.
