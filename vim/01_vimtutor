The best way to get to know vim is by practicing it.
And vim has good tutorial for starting inside your shell.
from your shell type below command, and you can follow the instruction there.
Normally it will take you 20-30 minutes to finish all the lesson in it.
--> vimtutor

I am now going to repeat the tutorial in vimtutor, so it is important for you to open it and learn.
once done then you can follow along other document in this folder.
