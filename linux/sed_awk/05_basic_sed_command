We are going to learn 4 editing command in sed.
d(delete, a(append), i(insert), and c(change).

the format of sed command is :
--> [address]command
A line address is optional with any command. 
It can be a pattern described as a regular expression surrounded by slashes, a line number, or a line-addressing symbol. 
Most sed commands can accept two comma-separated addresses that indicate a range of lines. 

A few commands accept only a single line address. They cannot be applied to a range of lines. The convention for them is:
--> [line-address]command

Remember also that commands can be grouped at the same address by surrounding the list of commands in braces:
--> address { 
--> 		command1
--> 		command2
--> 		command3
--> }

The first command can be placed on the same line with the opening brace but the closing brace must appear on its own line. 
Each command can have its own address and multiple levels of grouping are permitted. 
Also, as you can see from the indentation of the commands inside the braces, spaces, and tabs at the beginning of lines are permitted.

When sed is unable to understand a command, it prints the message “Command garbled.” 
One subtle syntax error is adding a space after a command. This is not allowed; the end of a command must be at the end of the line.

Proof of this restriction is offered by an “undocumented” feature: 
multiple sed commands can be placed on the same line if each one is separated by a semicolon.
--> n;d

Placing multiple commands on the same line is highly discouraged 
because sed scripts are difficult enough to read even when each command is written on its own line. 
(Note that the change, insert, and append commands must be specified over multiple lines and cannot be specified on the same line.)

You can use a comment to document a script by describing its purpose.
you can place comments anywhere in the script, even on a line following a command. 
An octothorpe (#) must be the first character on the line. The syntax of a comment line is:
--> #[n]

Substitution
============
We have already demonstrated many uses of the substitute command. Let’s look carefully at its syntax:
--> 	[address]s/pattern/replacement/flags
where the flags that modify the substitution are:
n
	A number (1 to 512) indicating that a replacement should be made for only the nth occurrence of the pattern.
g
	Make changes globally on all occurrences in the pattern space. Normally only the first occurrence is replaced.
p
	Print the contents of the pattern space.
w file
	Write the contents of the pattern space to file.

Unlike addresses, which require a slash (/) as a delimiter, the regular expression can be delimited by any character except a newline. 
Thus, if the pattern contained slashes, you could choose another character, such as an exclamation mark, as the delimiter.
--> s!/usr/mail!/usr2/mail!
or using dot
--> s./usr/mail./usr2/mail.

if a script contains multiple substitute commands that match the same line, multiple copies of that line will be printed or written to file.
The numeric flag can be used in the rare instances where the regular expression repeats itself on a line 
and the replacement must be made for only one of those occurrences by position. 
For instance, a line, perhaps containing tbl input, might contain multiple tabs. 
Let’s say that there are three tabs per line, and you’d like to replace the second tab with “>”. 
The following substitute command would do it
--> s/\t/>/2

Delete
=========
We previously showed examples of the delete command (d). It takes an address and deletes the contents of the pattern space if the line matches the address.
The delete command is also a command that can change the flow of control in a script. 
That is because once it is executed, no further commands are executed on the “empty” pattern space.
The delete command causes a new line of input to be read and a new pass on the editing script to begin from the top. 

The important thing to remember is: 
if the line matches the address, the entire line is deleted, not just the portion of the line that is matched. 
(To delete a portion of a line, use the substitute command and specify an empty replacement.) 
In the previous chapter, we showed a command to delete blank lines:
--> /^$/d

Another use of the delete command could be to strip out certain troff requests, 
such as those that add spacing, break the page, and turn fill mode off and on:
--> /^\.sp/d
--> /^\.bp/d
--> /^\.nf/d
--> /^\.fi/d
These commands delete an entire line. For instance, the first command will delete the line “.sp 1” or “.sp .03v”.

The delete command can be used to delete a range of lines. 
In the previous chapter, there is an example of deleting all tables from a file by deleting the lines between the .TS and .TE macros. 
There is also a delete command (D) used to delete a portion of a multiline pattern space. 
This advanced command is presented in the next chapter.

Append, Insert, and Change
==========================
The append (a), insert (i), and change (c) commands provide editing functions 
that are commonly performed with an interactive editor, such as vi. 
You may find it strange to use these same commands to “enter” text using a noninteractive editor. 
The syntax of these commands is unusual for sed because they must be specified over multiple lines. 
The syntax follows:

-->  append	[line-address]a\
-->i	 	text
-->  insert	[line-address]i\
--> 	 	text
-->  change	[address]c\
-->  		text

The insert command places the supplied text before the current line in the pattern space. 
The append command places it after the current line. 
The change command replaces the contents of the pattern space with the supplied text.

Each of these commands requires a backslash following it to escape the first end-of-line. 
The text must begin on the next line. To input multiple lines of text, each successive line must end with a backslash, 
with the exception of the very last line. 
For example, the following insert command inserts two lines of text at a line matching “<Larry’s Address>”:

--> /<Larry's Address>/i\
--> 4700 Cross Court\
--> French Lick, IN

The append and insert commands can be applied only to a single line address, not a range of lines. 
The change command, however, can address a range of lines. In this case, it replaces all addressed lines with a single copy of the text. 
In other words, it deletes each line in the range but the supplied text is output only once. 
For example, the following script, when run on a file containing a mail message:
--> /^From /,/^$/c\
--> <Mail Header Removed>

-->  sed '1i # Sampling few users, taken from the /etc/passwd file' my_file | sed '$a # You have reach then end of the file'




Look at the following series:
.sp 1.5
.sp
.sp 1
.sp 1.5v
.sp .3v
.sp 3

If you wanted to change all the arguments to “.5”, 
it is probably easier to use the change command than try to match all the individual arguments and make the proper substitution.
/^\.sp/c\
.sp .5

List 
======
The list command (l) displays the contents of the pattern space, showing non-printing characters as two-digit ASCII codes. 
It is similar in function to the list (:l) command in vi. You can use this command to detect “invisible” characters in the input

--> sed -n -e "l" test/spchar

Transform
===========
The transform command is peculiar, not only because it is the least mnemonic of all sed commands. 
This command transforms each character by position in string abc to its equivalent in string xyz
--> [address]y/abc/xyz/
The replacement is made by character position. Therefore, it has no idea of a “word.” 
Thus, “a” is replaced by “x” anywhere on the line, regardless of whether or not it is followed by a “b”. 
One possible use of this command is to replace lowercase letters with their uppercase counterparts.
--> y/abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz/ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ/

Print
========
The print command (p) causes the contents of the pattern space to be output. 
It does not clear the pattern space nor does it change the flow of control in the script. 
However, it is frequently used before commands (d, N, b) that do change flow control. 
Unless the default output is suppressed (-n), the print command will cause duplicate copies of a line to be output. 
It can be used when default output is suppressed or when the flow control through the program avoids reaching the bottom of the script.

a script that shows how the print command might be used for debugging purposes. 
It is used to show what the line looked like before you made any changes.
--> #n Print line before and after changes.
--> /^\.Ah/{
--> p
--> s/"//g
--> s/^\.Ah //p
--> }

Quit
=======
The quit command (q) causes sed to stop reading new input lines (and stop sending them to the output). Its syntax is:
--> [line-address]q

It can take only a single-line address. Once the line matching address is reached, the script will be terminated.
For instance, the following one-liner uses the quit command to print the first 100 lines from a file
--> sed '100q' test
It prints each line until it gets to line 100 and quits. In this regard, this command functions similarly to the UNIX head command.
