For learning grep you can use this website
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/grep-command-in-unixlinux/

Grep doest have and, it only have or and not.
But we can simulate and if we wanted. lets check how to do or first.
Let say i want to retrieve user joe and root from the /etc/passwd file
--> grep -e 'joe\|root' /etc/passwd
--> grep -E 'joe|root' /etc/paswd
--> grep -e joe -e root /etc/passwd

Grep all that not containing root
--> grep -v root /etc/passwd

to simulate and. grep everything that has word joe and bash
--> grep -e 'joe.*bash\|bash.*joe' /etc/passwd
--> grep -e joe /etc/passwd | grep bash

egrep is actually grep -E
and fgrep is actually grep -F
