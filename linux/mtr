The mtr command is a combination of ping and traceroute commands. 
It is a network diagnostic tool that continuously sends packets showing ping time for each hop. 
It also displays network problems of the entire route taken by the network packets.

The default behavior of the mtr command displays the traceroute report for a remote hostname or IP address. 
To display the traceroute report, pass the hostname or IP address with it as follows
--> mtr javatpoint.com
