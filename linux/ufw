ufw (uncomplicated firewall)

is a firewall configuration tool that runs on top of iptables, included by default within Ubuntu distributions. 
It provides a streamlined interface for configuring common firewall use cases via the command line.

To check the default rule, you need to open below file
--> cat /etc/default/ufw

setting default rule for incoming and outgoing
--> sudo ufw default allow outgoing
--> sudo ufw default deny incoming

to check ufw status
--> sudo ufw status

to enable or disable the fw, run below command.
--> sudo ufw enable
--> sudo ufw disable

to see the rules being added to ufw
--> sudo ufw show added

To block all network connections that originate from a specific IP address, run the following command, 
replacing the highlighted IP address with the IP address that you want to block
--> sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.100

If you need to block a full subnet, you may use the subnet address as from parameter on the ufw deny command. 
This would block all IP addresses in the example subnet 203.0.113.0/24
--> sudo ufw deny from 203.0.113.0/24

To block incoming connections from a specific IP address to a specific network interface, 
run the following command, replacing the highlighted IP address with the IP address you want to block
--> sudo ufw deny in on eth0 from 203.0.113.100

To allow all network connections that originate from a specific IP address, run the following command, 
replacing the highlighted IP address with the IP address that you want to allow access
--> sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.101

To allow incoming connections from a specific IP address to a specific network interface, 
run the following command, replacing the highlighted IP address with the IP address you want to allow
--> sudo ufw allow in on eth0 from 203.0.113.102

To delete a rule that you previously set up within UFW, use ufw delete followed by the rule (allow or deny) and the target specification. 
The following example would delete a rule previously set to allow all connections from an IP address of 203.0.113.10
--> sudo ufw delete allow from 203.0.113.101

Another way to specify which rule you want to delete is by providing the rule ID. This information can be obtained with the following command
--> sudo ufw status numbered
and then --> sudo ufw delete 1

Upon installation, applications that rely on network communications will typically set up a UFW profile 
that you can use to allow connection from external addresses. This is often the same as running ufw allow from, 
with the advantage of providing a shortcut that abstracts the specific port numbers a service uses and provides a user-friendly nomenclature to referenced services
To list which profiles are currently available, run the following:
--> sudo ufw app list

To enable a UFW application profile, run ufw allow followed by the name of the application profile you want to enable, 
which you can obtain with a sudo ufw app list command. In the following example, we’re enabling the OpenSSH profile, 
which will allow all incoming SSH connections on the default SSH port
--> sudo ufw allow “OpenSSH”

To disable an application profile that you had previously set up within UFW, you’ll need to remove its corresponding rule.
--> sudo ufw allow "Nginx HTTPS"
--> sudo ufw delete allow "Nginx Full"

The following command will allow only SSH connections coming from the IP address 203.0.113.103
--> sudo ufw allow from 203.0.113.103 proto tcp to any port 22

To allow all incoming HTTP and HTTPS (ports 80 and 443) connections, run
--> sudo ufw allow proto tcp from any to any port 80,443

Mail servers, such as Sendmail and Postfix, typically use port 25 for SMTP traffic. 
If your server shouldn’t be sending outgoing mail, you may want to block that kind of traffic. 
To block outgoing SMTP connections, run
--> sudo ufw deny out 25
