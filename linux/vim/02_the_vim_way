Our work is repetitive in nature. and vim is optimized for repetition.
Its eficiency stems from the way it tracks our most recent actions.
We can always replay the last change with a single keystroke.
Powerful as it sounds, it's useless unless we learn to craft our action so that 
they perform a useful unit of work when replayed.

REMEMBER : Mastering this concept is the key to becoming effective in vim

--------------------------------------
The dot command is our starting point.
--------------------------------------

To understand the power of dot command. We have to realize that the "last action"
could be one of many things. An action could act at the level of individual characters,
entire lines, or even the whole file.

for example, press x in normal mode will delete the character under the cursor.
if you want to delete again another character under the cursor, you just need to press (.)

press dd in certain line, will delete the line under the cursor.
and if you want to delete another line under the cursor,
you don't have to press dd again, you just need to press dit(.)

so you can imagine, the power of it, consider dot as mini macro inside vim.
the more complex and repeatable you action, the more powerful the impact of dot(.)

And the other important thing is to know your reverse gear when editing something in vim.
if You want to undo what you have made, press u in normal mode
if you want to undo all the changes in one line, go to that line and press U in normal mode
if you want to redo your undo, press control-r in normal mode
if you have read and follow the exercise in vimtutor, you should already be familiar with this!!!
