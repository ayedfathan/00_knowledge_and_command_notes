history command is used to view the previously executed command. This feature was not available in the Bourne shell. 
Bash and Korn support this feature in which every command executed is treated as the event and is associated 
with an event number using which they can be recalled and changed if required. 
These commands are saved in a history file. In Bash shell history command shows the whole list of the command.
--> history

show the limited number of commands that executed previously as follows
--> history 5

To execute the command number 120 in the history
--> !120

To print command before executing so that a wrong command does not get executed use :p after event number of command.
--> !120:p

This command can also be used along with grep
--> history | grep passwd

execute the most recent command
--> !!

To browse the history without history command, is using control-r in the shell, 
type your search and then pres control-r for keep on searching.
If you can get used to it, this is far more faster than using history command

To make sure you command doesn't written into the history file, put space before typing your commnad.
--> space space and then <command>

remove the command from the history
--> history -d 123

remove all command from the history
--> history -c
