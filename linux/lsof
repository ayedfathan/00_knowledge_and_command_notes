lsof or ‘LiSt Open Files’ is used to find out which files are open by which process. 
Since Linux/Unix considers everything as a files (pipes, sockets,directories, devices etc) 
we can use this command to identify which files are currently in use.


In the below example, it will show long listing of open files some of them are extracted 
for better understanding which displays the columns like Command, PID, USER, FD, TYPE etc.
90% most of the time you will care the data on column COMMAND, PID, USER, and NAME
--> lsof

COMMAND    PID      USER   FD      TYPE     DEVICE  SIZE/OFF       NODE NAME
init         1      root  cwd      DIR      253,0      4096          2 /
init         1      root  rtd      DIR      253,0      4096          2 /
init         1      root  txt      REG      253,0    145180     147164 /sbin/init
init         1      root  mem      REG      253,0   1889704     190149 /lib/libc-2.12.so
init         1      root   0u      CHR        1,3       0t0       3764 /dev/null
init         1      root   1u      CHR        1,3       0t0       3764 /dev/null
init         1      root   2u      CHR        1,3       0t0       3764 /dev/null
init         1      root   3r     FIFO        0,8       0t0       8449 pipe
init         1      root   4w     FIFO       0,8       0t0       8449 pipe
init         1      root   5r      DIR       0,10         0          1 inotify
init         1      root   6r      DIR       0,10         0          1 inotify
init         1      root   7u     unix 0xc1513880       0t0       8450 socket

Sections and it’s values are self-explanatory. However, we’ll review FD & TYPE columns more precisely.
FD – stands for File descriptor and may seen some of the values as:
	cwd current working directory
	rtd root directory
	txt program text (code and data)
	mem memory-mapped file
Also in FD column numbers like 1u is actual file descriptor and followed by u,r,w of it’s mode as:
	r for read access.
	w for write access.
	u for read and write access.
TYPE – of files and it’s identification.
	DIR – Directory
	REG – Regular file
	CHR – Character special file.
	FIFO – First In First Out

The below command will display the list of all opened files of user cyberpunk.
--> lsof -u cyberpunk

To find out all the running process of specific port, just use the following command with option -i. The below example will list all running process of port 22
--> lsof -i TCP:22

To list all the running process of open files of TCP Port ranges from 1-1024.
--> lsof -i TCP:1-1024

Below example shows user cyberpunk is using command like ping and /etc directory .
--> lsof -i -u cyberpunk

The following command with option ‘-i’ shows the list of all network connections ‘LISTENING & ESTABLISHED’.
--> lsof -i

The below example only shows whose PID is 1 [One].
--> lsof -p 1
in real life, if you want to use this. you will grep the process id first from ps command.
for example, i want to know all the files accessed by nginx process. so i will do
--> ps auwx|grep nginx
from here i will get the pid for nginx and then feed that id to
--> lsof -p <pid>

You want to know which processes access file /var/log/nginx/access.log
--> lsof /var/log/nginx/access.log

You want to know the binary run for certain process. you can do below
--> ps uuwx|grep nginx --> you get the pid and then
--> lsof -p <pid> | grep bin

What are the shared library open by nginx
--> lsof -p <pid> | grep .so

let say you want to know where certain process put their log.
this good if you forget the name of the log, or you really don't know where the log is
--> lsof -p <pid> | grep log

let say, you have certain library that already patch. and you want to make sure
that the old library path are not being used anymore.
--> lsof /path/to/the/library
and then for each of the command you find, you need to restart the services to used the new lib
