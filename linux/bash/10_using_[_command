sing the [ command
A better-known form of the test command is the [ command. 
The primary difference between the two is that ] must be the last argument to [. 
This makes it look very much like a special syntax for shell script, but it isn't; it's just another command:

--> $ [ "$myshell" = 'bash' ] && printf 'Match!\n'

Being a command, this syntax can be used after if, just like the grep and cd examples earlier in this chapter:

--> myshell=bash
--> if [ "$myshell" = 'bash' ] ; then
-->     printf 'Match!\n'
--> fi

This is all specified by POSIX. Note that we still had to quote our variable to prevent special characters in its value from causing unwanted glob or whitespace expansion.
