Exit values
You can check the exit value from the last command from $?
--> $ rmdir ~/nonexistent
--> rmdir: failed to remove '/home/bashuser/nonexistent': No such file or directory
--> $ echo $?
--> 1

--> $ mkdir ~/existent
--> $ echo $?
--> 0
--> $ rmdir ~/existent
--> $ echo $?
--> 0

It's standard for programs to return 0 when they succeed, and something greater than 0 if they fail. 
Beyond that, programs vary in which exit values they choose for error conditions.
