Running command in sequence
You can send an interactive command line with more than one simple command in it, separating them with a semicolon, one of several possible control operators. 
Bash will then execute the commands in sequence, waiting for each simple command to finish before it starts the next one. 
For example, we could write the following command line and issue it in an interactive Bash session:
--> $ cd ; ls -a ; mkdir New

For this command line, note that even if one of the commands fails, Bash will still keep running the next command.

If you wanted to issue a set of commands on one command line, but only to continue if every command worked, 
you would use the double-ampersand (&&) control operator, instead of the semicolon (;):
--> $ cd && rmdir ~/nonexistent && ls

Similarly, if we changed the cd command at the start of the command line to change into a directory that didn't exist, the command line would stop even earlier:
--> bash$ cd ~/nonexistent && rmdir ~/nonexistent && ls
--> bash: cd: /home/bashuser/nonexistent: No such file or directory
