Piping output from multiple programs
The most straightforward way to do this is with a group command, which is delimited with curly brackets, { and }:
--> $ { date ; hostname ; } | tr a-z A-Z
--> MON JUL 30 21:38:52 NZST 2018
--> BASHSERVER.EXAMPLE.NET.

Input and output redirection can also apply to compound commands:
--> $ { date ; printf '%s\n' apple carrot banana ; } > mywords
--> $ { read date ; printf '%s\n' "$date" ; sort ; } < mywords
