Sending output to more than one file
using output redirection you can send the output of command to a file.
if you want to send to multiple file, then use tee
--> $ printf 'Copy this output\n' | tee myfile
--> Copy this output
--> $ cat myfile
--> Copy this output

Notice that the output went to both the terminal and to myfile. This works when multiple files are specified, too:

--> $ printf 'Copy this output\n' | tee myfile1 myfile2 myfile3
--> Copy this output
--> $ ls myfile*
--> myfile1  myfile2  myfile3

You can use the -a option of tee to append to files rather than overwriting them, much like using >> instead of >.
