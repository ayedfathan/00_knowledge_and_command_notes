dig command stands for Domain Information Groper. It is used for retrieving information about DNS name servers. 
It is basically used by network administrators. It is used for verifying and troubleshooting DNS problems and to perform DNS lookups. 
Dig command replaces older tools such as nslookup and the host.

Installing dig command in debian or ubuntu
--> sudo apt-get install dnsutils

To query domain “A” record for geeksforgeeks.org
--> dig geeksforgeeks.org

To query domain “A” record with +short, just to show the IP, no other information
--> dig geeksforgeeks.org +short

To query all DNS record types.
--> dig geeksforgeeks.org ANY

everse DNS lookup can be used to fetch domain name or the host name from the IP address.
“-x” option is used to perform reverse DNS lookup
--> dig -x 8.8.8.8

Understanding section in dig output. You can check below link

By default, if no name server is specified, dig uses the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf file.
To specify a name server against which the query will be executed, use the @ (at) symbol 
followed by the name server IP address or hostname
For example, to query the Google name server (8.8.8.8) for information about the linux.org domain you would use
--> dig linux.org @8.8.8.8

If you want to query a large number of domains, you can add them in a file (one domain per line) 
and use the -f option followed by the file name.
In the following example, we are querying the domains listed in the domains.txt file
--> domains.txt
	lxer.com
	linuxtoday.com
	tuxmachines.org
--> dig -f domains.txt +short
